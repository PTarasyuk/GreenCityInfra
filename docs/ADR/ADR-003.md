# ADR-003: Kubernetes Resource Deployment Approach in AWS

## Status

Proposed | **Accepted** | Rejected | Deprecated

## Context

We needed to deploy three services (`Core`, `User` and `Front`) in AWS EKS and a PostgreSQL database in AWS RDS.
The `Core`, `User` services and the database should reside in a *private VPC*, while the `Front` service should be in a *public VPC*.
Our goal is to determine the best approach for managing Kubernetes resources within AWS EKS and RDS using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## Solution

We have chosen **Terraform**(**OpenTofu**) + **Kustomize** (**YAML**) for Kubernetes resource management due its flexibility, GitOps compatibility (ArgoCD or Flux), and ease of debugging.
This approach ensures that our infrastructure (EKS, RDS, VPS) remains by Terraform (OpenTofu) while application resources can be handled using native Kubernetes tooling.

## Alternatives

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Terraform<br>Kubernetes Provider** | - Unified infrastructure management<br>- State management<br>- Declarative approach | - Limited feature support<br>- No native templating<br>- Increased complexity |
| **Terraform +<br>Helm Provider** | - Reusability with Helm charts<br>- Advanced configuration with Helm values<br>- Strong ecosystem | - Dependency on Helm<br>- Added complexity<br>- Terraform state issues with Helm releases |
| **Terraform +<br>Kustomize/YAML** | - Full control with YAML<br>- GitOps compatibility<br>- Easier debugging<br>- Decoupled state | - Separate deployment process<br>- Manual YAML management<br>- Requires additional tooling |

### 1. Terraform Kubernetes Provider

**Pros**:

- **Unified Infrastructure Management**:
  Everything, including EKS and Kubernetes resources, is managed within Terraform.
- **State Management**:
  Terraform state ensures resource tracking and drift detection.
- **Declarative Approach**:
  Ensures a predictable and repeatable infrastructure setup.

**Cons**:

- **Limited Features**:
  The Terraform `kubernetes` provider lacks support for certain Kubernetes features such as CRDs and advanced networking configurations.
- **No Native Templating**:
  Unlike Helm or Kustomize, Terraform does not offer dynamic templating, making resource definitions repetitive.
- **Increased Complexity**:
  Managing Kubernetes manifests within Terraform can be cumbersome and harder to maintain.

### 2. Terraform + Helm Provider

**Pros**:

- **Reusability**:
  Helm charts provide a modular and reusable way to package Kubernetes applications.
- **Advanced Configuration**:
  Helm values allow easy customization of deployments.
- **Strong Ecosystem**:
  Many widely used Kubernetes components (e.g., `nginx-ingress`, `cert-manager`) have well-maintained Helm charts.

**Cons**:

- **Dependency on Helm**:
  Requires Helm expertise and an understanding of its templating system.
- **Complexity**:
  Helm charts introduce another layer of abstraction, which may complicate debugging and troubleshooting.
- **Terraform State Issues**:
  Helm releases are tracked in Terraform state, which can lead to inconsistencies when managing upgrades or rollbacks.

### 3. Terraform + Kustomize/YAML (Selected)

**Pros**:

- **Flexibility**:
  YAML manifests provide full control over Kubernetes configurations without Terraform limitations.
- **GitOps Compatibility**:
  Works seamlessly with GitOps tools like ArgoCD and Flux.
- **Easier Debugging**:
  Changes can be tested locally using `kubectl apply` before applying them in a cluster.
- **Decoupled State Management**:
  Kubernetes resources are not tied to Terraform state, reducing the risk of breaking changes during updates.

**Cons**:

- **Separate Deployment Process**:
  Terraform and Kubernetes resources need to be deployed independently.
- **Manual Management**:
  Without a Helm-like templating system, YAML manifests can become verbose and repetitive.
- **Additional Tooling**:
  Requires `kubectl` and `Kustomize` to be properly integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

## Justification

The **Terraform** (**OpenTofu**) + **Kustomize** (**YAML**) approach provides the best balance between control, flexibility, and maintainability.
By keeping Kubernetes resources separate from Terraform state, we avoid issues related to state drift and dependency management.
This method also enables easy integration with GitOps workflows, allowing for better automation and visibility.

## Consequences

### Pros

- Terraform remains responsible for infrastructure provisioning (EKS, RDS, VPC, IAM roles, etc.).
- Kubernetes resources are defined using YAML manifests and managed with `kubectl apply` or `Kustomize` overlays.
- A CI/CD pipeline will be configured to handle Kubernetes deployments separately from infrastructure provisioning.
- Future enhancements, such as integration with ArgoCD, can be explored to enable a fully automated GitOps workflow.

### Cons

- Separate deployment pipelines are required for Terraform and Kubernetes resources.
- Manual YAML management may require additional structuring to avoid redundancy.
- Developers and DevOps engineers need familiarity with both Terraform and Kustomize for effective workflow management.
