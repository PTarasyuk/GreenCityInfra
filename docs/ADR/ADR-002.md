# ADR-002: Templating and Centralized Management of Dockerfile

## Status

Proposed | **Accepted** | Rejected | Deprecated

## Context

The GreenCity project consists of several microservices:

- Frontend (Node.js - Angular)
- Core Service (Java)
- User Service (Java)

Each service requires its own Dockerfile to create containers.
Currently:

1. **Current issues**:
   - Code duplication in Dockerfile between services
   - Difficulty in maintaining
   - Lack of standardization
   - Need for different build variants (with tests/without tests)

2. **Requirements for the solution**:
   - Centralized storage of templates
   - Easy integration with CI/CD pipeline
   - Ability to parameterize (versions, settings)
   - Support for multi-stage builds
   - Minimal dependencies

## Solution

1. **Using `confd` for templating**:

   ```text
   confd/
   ├── conf.d/                   # `confd` configuration
   │   ├── Dockerfile-java.toml
   │   └── Dockerfile-node.toml
   └── templates/                # Dockerfile templates
       ├── Dockerfile-java.tmpl    # For Java services
       └── Dockerfile-node.tmpl    # For Node.JS (Angular)
   ```

2. **Integration with CI/CD**:
   - Reusable workflow in the infrastructure repository
   - Parameters via workflow inputs:

     ```yaml
     inputs:
       engine_type:     # java or node
       engine_version:  # engine version
       app_name:        # application name
       app_version:     # application version
     ```

3. **Standardization of Dockerfile**:
   - Multi-stage builds for optimization
   - Security configuration
   - Standard environment variables
   - Optional execution of tests

## Alternatives

### 1. Python with Jinja2

**Pros**:

- Powerful templating language
- Flexibility in configuration
- Ability to complex logic

**Cons**:

- Requires Python
- More complex syntax

### 2. Separate Dockerfile in each repository

**Pros**:

- Simple implementation
- Independence of services

**Cons**:

- Code duplication
- Difficulty in maintenance
- Lack of standardization

## Consequences

### Pros

- Single standard for all services
- Centralized management of versions
- Simple integration with GitHub Actions
- Easy update of templates
- Minimal dependencies

### Cons

- Limited functionality of confd
- Requires installing confd in CI/CD
- Dependency on the infrastructure repository
