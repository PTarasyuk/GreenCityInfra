# ADR-001: Centralized Management of CI/CD Configurations

## Status

Proposed | **Accepted** | Rejected | Deprecated

## Context

The GreenCity project currently has CI/CD configurations (GitHub Actions workflows) for various projects (Java, Node.js, etc.) stored directly in the repositories of these projects.
This leads to the following issues:

- **Code Duplication**
  Similar configurations are copied between repositories.
- **Update Complexity**
  Changes in CI/CD processes (e.g., tool version updates, adding new checks) require manual updates in each repository.
- **Inconsistency**
  Different projects may use different tool versions or approaches to build and deployment.
- **Lack of a Unified Standard**
  There is no single place to view and manage CI/CD configurations for all projects.

## Solution

To address the above issues, it is proposed to implement centralized management of CI/CD configurations using **GitHub Actions reusable workflows** in this infrastructure repository.

**Solution Description:**

1. **Infrastructure Repository**:
   Use this infrastructure repository on GitHub, which will contain:
   - ***Reusable workflow*** for common CI/CD stages (complying Java or Node.js applications, testing, building and publishing Docker images).

2. **Application/Service Repositories**:
   - Contain minimal GitHub Actions workflows that *call* reusable workflows from the infrastructure repository.
   - Pass necessary parameters (e.g., application name, version, specific settings) to reusable workflows.

3. **Versioning**:
   The infrastructure repository uses Git tags for versioning templates and reusable workflows.
   Application repositories specify a specific version of the infrastructure repository (tag, branch, or SHA git commit) when calling reusable workflows.

## Alternatives

The following alternative approaches were considered:

### 1. Storing Complete YAML Workflow Files in the Infrastructure Repository

**Pros**:

- ***Full Centralization***:
  All CI/CD configurations in one place.
- ***Easy Updates***:
  Changes in workflow templates automatically apply to all projects.
- ***Simplicity of Implementation***.

**Cons**:

- ***Less Flexibility***:
  Difficult to make changes specific to individual projects.
- ***Risk of Incompatibility***:
  If a change in the template is incompatible with a project, it may cause CI/CD failures.
- ***Difficulty in Making Temporary Changes*** for a single project.

### 2. Using GitHub Actions Composite Actions

**Composite actions** allow creating reusable parts of a workflow.
A composite action can be defined in the infrastructure repository and then used in the workflows of your applications.

**Pros**:

- ***Centralization***:
  Allows managing common CI/CD processes from one place.
- ***Reusability***:
  Ensures reuse of CI/CD configuration code.
- ***Flexibility***:
  Allows adding project-specific steps in the workflows of application repositories.
- ***Improved Support***:
  Changes in CI/CD processes need to be made only in one place.

**Cons**:

- ***Setup Complexity***:
  Requires understanding the concept of composite actions.
- ***Slightly More Complex Structure*** than storing complete YAML files.
- ***Does Not Support Nesting***:
  A composite action cannot directly call another composite action.

## Justification

The choice of **reusable workflows** is justified as follows:

- **Maximum Centralization**:
  Reusable workflows provide the highest level of centralization and reuse of CI/CD configurations.
- **Full Control**:
  Allows complete control over the CI/CD process from a single place, minimizing the risk of inconsistency between projects.
- **Security**:
  Workflow code is hidden from application repositories, enhancing security.
- **Long-term Perspective**:
  Although reusable workflows are more complex to set up, they offer the best scalability and support in the long term.

## Consequences

### Pros

- Maximum reduction of code duplication.
- Simplification of CI/CD process updates.
- Highest consistency between projects.
- Simplification of CI/CD configuration support.
- Improved visibility of CI/CD processes.
- Enhanced security of CI/CD processes.

### Cons

- Developers need to be trained to use reusable workflows.
- There is a dependency on the infrastructure repository (its availability and reliability must be ensured).
- More complex initial configuration.
